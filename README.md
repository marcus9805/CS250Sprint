# CS250Sprint
Sprint Review and Retrospective deliverable

1. To interpret user needs and implement them into a program I would gather the requirements from stakeholders and translate them for the development team. Creating user stories help by breaking down the stakeholders requirements into action steps so the whole team can easily understand and implement them.

2. I approach developing programs by following an iterative and incremental methodology, emphasizing continuous feedback and improvement. Agile processes such as Scrum, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Reviews.

3. Being a good team member in software development means actively contributing to the team's goals, problem solving and communicating effectively.
